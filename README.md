Library Management System Project

Introduction
The Library Management System is a Python-based application designed to effectively manage a small community library.
The system allows users to manage a collection of books, handle user accounts, facilitate book borrowing and returning, manage book reservations, and apply fines for overdue books.
Additionally, it maintains detailed transaction logs of all activities within the library.

Objective
The objective of this project is to create a comprehensive system that assists in 
managing a library, providing tools for library staff and members to organize and 
borrow books easily and efficiently. The system focuses on streamlining the process 
of book and user management while ensuring that all activities related to borrowing 
and returning books are tracked and recorded.

Key Features
•	Book Management: The library can add new books, remove old or damaged books, and display details of all available books.
•	User Management: Users can be added with specific roles (Admin/Regular User),and the system displays user details, including borrowed books and fines.
•	Borrowing and Returning Books: Users can borrow books if they are available, return them, and incur fines if the books are overdue.
•	Reservation System: Users can reserve books that are currently borrowed, so they can access them once they are returned.
•	Fine Management: The system calculates and applies fines for overdue books based on the length of the delay.
•	Transaction Logs: The system keeps a log of all transactions, such as borrowing and returning books.

Educational Goal
This project aims to apply Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts in developing a practical system, helping to deepen the understanding of these concepts by building a real-world library management system that is functional and useful
